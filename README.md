# Jerk Trial

One of your friends is on trial, and it's up to you to prove their guilt or innocence! Play the game in your phone or browser [here](http://evening-plateau-97201.herokuapp.com/). Perfect for Zoom calls!

Made for the [UArizona Spring 2020 Virtual Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/ua-game-dev-spring-2020-game-jam).

## The rules

One player's been accused of something bad, and the other players have to decide if the accused player is "in the wrong" here. Maybe they did the thing, but they were right to do it! One player is assigned to be the "judge", and they get to decide.

The other players are "witnesses", on the defense and prosecution. The player that's been accused is on the defense, of course, and one player's placed on the prosecution, but everyone else decides what side they're on! Each of the players on each side will be given some of the evidence that's been collected and asked by the judge to present that evidence. Then, once everyone's had a chance to speak, the judge hands out their ruling.

### Start the game

First, one player has to make a room. Enter your name and hit "Create new room". Then, other players can use the room code on the first player's screen to join their room. When you're ready to begin (and have at least 4 players), the first player can hit "Start playing".
